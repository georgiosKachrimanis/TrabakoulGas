# Ergasia 2
## First Draft
This is an ongoing project for my University course of Telecommunications class.
The idea is at the end of the semester to have a functional website. 

The website will be a platform for gas station all over Greece offering discounts on various types of gasoline for 
as sort period of time.

The project will start with a basic HTML CSS design and more functionality will be added using JS, PHP XML etc.

The first completed draft of the paper is done 22-01-2023.
It contains basic concepts of creating a web page with HTML and CSS.

## Second Draft
There is added functionality with the use of php and DB. 
Now we can add users which in return can create announcements and offers for fuels.
The code is a mess and will have to re-write everything when I have more time as it is a nice project to show
good practice of web development.


## Third Draft
Some more functionality added to create xml files, for superusers.
