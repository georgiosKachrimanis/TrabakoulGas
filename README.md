# Web Platform for Gas Stations.
## What is this about?
*Disclaimer*
This web page was a school project in the last year of my 4 years studies in Computer Science. Unfortunately, because of my RL situation (Family, Full time work  etc.) the code of the page is all over the place. 

So, the idea is to create a web platform for Gas Stations to add their offers (the lowest price Petrol, Gas etc). 

## How it works
As you can see from the code you have to run an XAMPP localhost and MariaDB(Free tools).

*I will provide the tables structure of the DB after I clean up the code. The Idea is to automate this procedure.*

Then when you run the Server companies can create accounts and put their offers. 
Simple! 
Nothing special just Basic HTML, CSS, JS
